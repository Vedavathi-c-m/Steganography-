# Steganography-
LSB-based image steganography in C to securely hide and extract secret data.
🔐 Image Steganography Using LSB in C

This project implements Image Steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique in C programming. It securely hides secret text inside BMP images and retrieves it without causing any visible change to the image. The project demonstrates real-world concepts of data security, file handling, and bit manipulation.

✅ Features

Encode secret text inside BMP images

Decode hidden data accurately

Uses LSB algorithm for data hiding

No visible distortion in output image

Binary file handling for images

Command-line based execution

Stores secret data permanently

Supports large BMP images

🛠 Technologies Used

C Programming

File Handling (Binary Mode)

Bitwise Operations

BMP Image Processing

VS Code

Linux / WSL
✅ Advantages

High level of data security

No visible change in image quality

Secret data remains completely hidden

Simple and efficient algorithm

Fast encoding and decoding

Easy to implement in C

Works on large BMP images

No extra encryption libraries required

Maintains original image appearance

Suitable for secure text transmission

⚠️ Limitations

Works best only with BMP images

Limited data hiding capacity

Not suitable for compressed images like JPG, PNG

If the image is modified or compressed, hidden data may be lost

LSB technique is vulnerable to advanced steganalysis

Requires large image size for more data

Not suitable for hiding very large files

Stego image size becomes slightly larger
